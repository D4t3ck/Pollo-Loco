            <h2>Story</h2>
            <p>Welcome to Mexico amigo!</p>
            <p>
              In a small Mexican village named "Pollopia," known for its
              delicious chicken dishes, unrest reigns. The chickens, once loyal
              companions to humans, have risen against their former masters. But
              that's not the worst – they follow a gigantic, mutated chicken,
              larger than all others. This monster chicken has taken control and
              plans to subjugate humanity.
            </p>

            <p>
              In this time of crisis, Pepe Peligroso steps up. A brave Mexican
              with a sharp mind and an even sharper mustache. The government has
              tasked him with combating the threat posed by the rebellious
              chickens and saving humanity.
            </p>

            <p>
              Armed with his courage and his favorite weapon, a bottle of spicy
              salsa sauce, Pepe sets out. He traverses dangerous terrain, from
              the dusty streets of the village to the dark forests where the
              chickens lurk.
            </p>

            <p>
              With skillful jumps and swift movements, Pepe navigates through
              the levels, collecting salsa sauce and gold coins, and battling
              the hordes of chickens. Finally, he reaches the climax of his
              adventure – an epic showdown against the gigantic chicken.

              Liability for content<br />The contents of our pages have been
              created with the utmost care. However, we cannot guarantee the

              service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these
              pages in accordance with § 7 para.1 TMG (German Telemedia Act) and
              general laws. According to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, we are not obligated as
              a service provider to monitor transmitted or stored third-party
              information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal
              activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of information
              under general laws remain unaffected. However, liability in this
              regard is only possible from the time of knowledge of a concrete
              infringement. Upon becoming aware of such infringements, we will
              remove the content immediately.

              time of linking. However, permanent monitoring of the content of
              the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete indications of
              a violation of the law. Upon becoming aware of legal violations,
              we will remove such links immediately.
